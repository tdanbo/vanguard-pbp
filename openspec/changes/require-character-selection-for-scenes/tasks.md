# Tasks

## 1. Frontend Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Update CampaignDashboard to show empty state when no character selected and fog of war enabled
- [x] 1.2 Skip scene fetch when no character is selected (fog of war enabled, non-GM)
- [x] 1.3 Update empty state message to prompt character selection

## 2. Validation

- [x] 2.1 Test: Player with no character selected sees "select a character" message
- [x] 2.2 Test: Player who selects a character sees their character-scoped scenes
- [x] 2.3 Test: GM still sees all scenes regardless of character selection
- [x] 2.4 Test: Fog of war disabled still shows all scenes without character selection
